empty.sh -> Q1 Part A

duplicate.sh -> Q1 Part B

Everything else is named as per the question number.

for question 4, I have taken a list of numbers seperated by commas as input from the user. The way to give input is:

./Q4.sh

# After this, the screen will clear and there will be a prompt where the user can enter a list of numbers(seperated by commas). 

2,4,5,1,9,8

# output

1 2 4 5 8 9
